# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! The title says it all. This is a minigame of the extended version of the rock, paper, scissors game. Adding the lizard and spock as extra possibilities. The game was originally invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, but it wasn't widely known until the comedy central show "The Big Bang Theory" made it popular.

This minigame was build in a fully responsive JavaScript website. The human player will play against a computer based on a random number generator. The chances of you winning are as high as the chances of you losing.
